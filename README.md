# Spam filter 
A spam filtering program that takes emails as input and returns if they are SPAM or HAM.
# Instructions
To use the filter, you need to utlize two datasets, a training and your main testing dataset. You may make your own or download from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yQjkxb2bXWRcAtL8dHsu4GkNS_Wd9FyK?usp=sharing).  
Simply launch the main.py file and run it, and a list of emails from the testing dataset will be printed in the terminal, with the name of the file and its SPAM or HAM right next to it. It would look something like this -

If using your own dataset, you may use the training dataset provided and simply place the email you want to be tested in the "testing" folder under "corpus".  
Then proceed as instructed above.
